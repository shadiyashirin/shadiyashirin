# Hi, I'm Shadiya Shirin V! üëã

### üöÄ About Me

I'm a passionate Computer Science Engineering student at APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, actively pursuing opportunities as a **Software Engineer** and **Back-End Developer**. Based in Kannur, India, I'm driven by a desire to build robust, efficient, and scalable solutions that address real-world challenges.

My journey in tech is fueled by curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning. I love diving deep into backend architectures and am also keen on exploring the fascinating domains of **Cybersecurity** and **Generative AI**, where I've already gained foundational knowledge through certifications.

I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to contribute to impactful projects. My recent participation as a **finalist at TinkerHack 3.0**, Kerala's largest women's hackathon (March 2025), highlights my ability to deliver innovative solutions under pressure.
